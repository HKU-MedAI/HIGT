## Update:

I'm very sorry for the late update. Then this is a tutorial I wrote before about the use of [HIGT](https://github.com/mateguo0/WSI_Tuts/blob/main/tut_HIGT.ipynb) and [MulGT](https://github.com/mateguo0/WSI_Tuts/blob/main/tut_MulGT.ipynb) (including data preprocessing and training and testing). 

Besides, I very hope this tutorial can help you solve your problems. And if there are any problems when using the tutorial, please leave a issue and I will provide feedback as soon as possible.
